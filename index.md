# [](#header-1)Bio

<p>I am currently a Ph.D. student of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Tsinghua University (THU). I am also under the joint Ph.D. program between THU and Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). My supervisor is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bainguo/">Baining Guo</a> and <a href="http://www.davidwipf.com/">David Wipf.</a></p>

<p>My interests include variational autoencoder (VAE), sparse learning and deep learning. Now I am working on projects in analyzing the properties of VAE both theoretically and empirically.</p>
